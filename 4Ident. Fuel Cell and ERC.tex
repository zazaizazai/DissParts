\part{Identification of fuel cells and electromagnetic reverberations chambers}

\section{Fuel cell}

\subsection{Fuel cell technology use}

Fuel cells belong to the group of galvanic elements, which, as electrochemical
energy converters, can convert the chemical energy of a fuel into
electrical energy. Since fuel cells can generate electricity directly
from chemical energy, they are much more efficient than internal combustion
engines \citep{Kurzweil2016}. The principle of the fuel cell was
discovered in 1838 by Christian Friedrich Schönbein and soon after,
Sir William Grove, along with Schönbein, recognized the reversal of
electrolysis and power generation. With the invention of the electrical
generator by Werner von Siemens, the invention known as the \textquotedbl gas
battery\textquotedbl{} fell into oblivion. It wasn't until the 1950s
that the idea was revived due to the need for compact and portable
power sources in space travel and the military. Global warming and
air pollution gave research into this technology decisive impetus
that continues to this day.

\subsection{Principle of operation}

A fuel cell consists of a cathode, anode coated with catalysts such
as platinum or nickel and a membrane Fig \ref{fig:Basic-structure-and}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{\string"images/reactionin fuel cellbearb.1\string".eps}
\par\end{centering}
\centering{}\caption{\label{fig:Basic-structure-and}Basic structure and functioning of
a fuel cell \citep{prezi.com}}
\end{figure}

The anode is supplied with hydrogen $\left[\textrm{\ensuremath{\mathsf{\textrm{H}}}}_{2}\right]$,
which oxidizes to protons $\left[2\mathsf{\textrm{H}}^{+}\right]$
on the catalyst layer, giving off electrons $\left[2\textrm{e}^{-}\right]$.
The proton exchange membrane (PEM) is only permeable for ions, so
only the ions flow to the cathode via PEM. The electrons flow from
the anode to the cathode via an external circuit and form the electric
current. Both hydrogen protons and electrons migrate to the cathode,
where they react with the supplied oxygen $\left[\textrm{O}_{2}\right]$
to form water $\left[\textrm{H}_{2}\textrm{O}\right]$. Depending
on the operating point, a single cell delivers a certain voltage between
0.5 and 1.0 volts. For higher voltages, individual cells are connected
in series and a so-called stack is obtained as the core element of
the fuel cell.

\subsection{Types of fuel cells}

There are different types of fuel cells, which differ in the electrolyte
used, in the operating temperature, in the fuels that can be used
and in the power range and thus the areas of application Fig \ref{fig:Different-fuel-cell}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{images/fctypes}
\par\end{centering}
\caption{\label{fig:Different-fuel-cell}Different fuel cell types \citep{Panayiotou2010}}

\end{figure}

AFC are among the earliest researched fuel cell types and were mainly
used in space travel deployed. Operating efficiency: about 60\% to
70\%. Proton Exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) use membrane foil
called Nafion and Electrodes with platinum layers as catalysts. They
are powered by hydrogen or finely purified reformate from simple hydrocarbons
such as natural gas, LPG or alcohols. These cells are used in home
power supplies, power plants, submarines and space travel and have
an efficiency of 40-60\%. Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC) are operated
with liquid methanol and a membrane foil is used as the electrolyte.
Due to the low power density, these cells are mainly used as battery
chargers. Molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFC) have a molten carbonate
electrolyte. Because of the operating temperature of approx. 650°C
and the resulting high reaction speeds, therefore no expensive noble
metal catalysts are required. They are operated with desulfurized
natural and coal gas or suitably cleaned biogas. MCFC systems are
developed for the power plant range from 200 kW to several MW and
have an efficiency of 50\% to 65\%. Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC)
are operated with a solid ceramic metal oxide as the electrolyte.
The operating temperature of 800°C enable that no expensive noble
metal catalysts are required. These cells can be operated with fossil
gases or biogas. SOFC systems are developed in the power range from
1 kW to 200 kW and have an efficiency of 60-65\% \citep{schaloske2012energietrager}.

\subsection{Challenges and solutions}

The fuel technology is mature in many areas and in regular operation.
In particular, passenger cars, forklifts and micro combined heat and
power plants (CHP) for residential buildings are among the mature
applications and are already commercially available, followed by buses,
emergency generators, industrial CHP plants and various network services.
However, there are many possible ones Hydrogen and fuel applications
Cells where no comparable experiences have been made so far and which
are still in the research and development phase. These include, for
example Trains, waste disposal vehicles and delivery vehicles, but
also heavy duty trucks as well airplanes and ships. The challenge
for the use of the technology also remains in terms of infrastructure
as well as expanding the filling stations for hydrogen. In addition
to the infrastructure The further development of the production facilities
is a challenge, especially in the transition to serial production.
For this reason Know-how transfer is essential for the market ramp-up,
to reduce existing reservations and gaps in knowledge \citep{weichenhain2020potenziale}.

\section{Electromagnetic reverberations chamber}

\subsection{Application of a reverberations chamber}

Electromagnetic reverberations chambers (ERCs, alternatively mode
stirred chambers, MSC) was first proposed in 1968 \citep{mendes1968new}\citep{hill1998electromagnetic}
and they are used for various electromagnetic compatibility (EMC)
test procedures, e.g. immunity test, radiated emissions or screening
effectiveness tests. MSCs consist of a electromagnetic cavity resonator
fed by an RF source. Inside any electromagnetic cavity resonator both
electric and magnetic field are spatially arranged in so called resonant
modes based on standing waves. Additionally, an asymmetric metal piece,
the so-called mode stirrer, is mounted in a wall of the resonator,
which can be turned to modify the boundary conditions for the electric
field.

Resonators which are operated at a frequency at which a sufficiently
large number of resonant modes are excited are called overmoded. In
the case of an overmoded reverberation chambers equipped with a moving
mode-stirrer, it has been demonstrated that the statistic of the field
amplitude is supposed to be uniform in the working volume. Using a
mode-stirring object, the main objective is to produce a statistically
uniform electromagnetic field in the sense of homogeneity (uniformity
with regard to the location - spatial uniformity) and isotropy (uniformity
with regard to the orientation - polarization uniformity) of the field.
The latest properties are directly linked to the number of significantly
excited modes, the quality factor $Q$, often estimated as a composite
quality factor, which quantifies the amount of energy stored in the
reverberation chamber, their bandwidth $BW_{q}=f/Q$ and finally the
stirring efficiency $S_{e}$. More details can be found in \citep{Serra}.

A DUT placed inside the working volume of a functioning chamber is
exposed to an electromagnetic field with constant magnitude and normally
distributed angle of incidence and polarization plane.

ERCs became one of the focuses of research in the electromagnetic
compatibility community some 15 years, and many investigations did
show that the ERC enables the characterization of electronic devices
in a statistically evaluated electromagnetic field which exists in
a subvolume of the resonator's interior, the so called test volume.
Subject to random variables, the description of a stochastic exposure
requires the modeling of physical phenomena related to the electromagnetic
source and the physical properties of the device under test (DUT).
One of the test environment, which allows the simulation of stochastic
process, is the Electromagnetic Reverberation Chamber (ERC) \citep{crawford_koepke_2017}.
It's development was inspired from autistic reverberation chambers
which are used for sound tests.

During the design process of a reverberation chamber, the size of
the test volume will be defined so that the lowest usable frequency
(LUF), the lowest frequency at which the resonator is overmoded) cover
the frequency band of interest for the susceptibility evaluation and
that the working volume can host the device under test taking into
account a minimal distance between the device under test and the walls
at a quarter of the longest wavelength. Many studies have been dealing
with the ideal and efficient way to create the required uniform and
isotope fields . Readers can refer to \citep{Serra} and to \citep{houchouas2015system}
regarding mechanical mode-stirrers comparison. The validation of the
test environment is defined in \citep{houchouas2015system}. Interestingly,
later studies have leveraged the use of chaotic processes in fixed
environments to improve the mechanical stirring approach (hybrid techniques)
in order to obtain an efficient test environment \citep{Selemani2015}.

\subsection{Technical challenges}

In an ERC it is desirable that the DUT is evenly irradiated from all
sides. This is achieved by a statistically uniform and isotropic field
in the chamber. Factors such as the broadband bandwidth of the antenna,
the nature of the walls (surface geometry and conductivity), the size
of the chamber and thus the frequency used as well as the shape and
number of stirrers play a role. In practice, vivaldi antennas and
logper antennas are mainly used as excitation antennas because of
their broadband. As a rule, iron sheets are used to ensure good conductivity
of the walls. Interesting objects of investigation are geometric shapes
attached to the walls, which specify irregular boundary conditions
for the field and the shape and number of stirrers that swirl the
field. These aspects ensure a homogeneous field quality and consisted
of many works.
