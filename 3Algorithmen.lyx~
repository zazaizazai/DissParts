Finite Element Method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Basic principle of finite element method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The finite element method (FEM) is a numerical method for the approximate
 solution of problems which are described by differential equations.
 The practical use of FEM began in the 1950s in construction specially in
 the aerospace and car industry.
 The technique is based on the fact that the calculation area will be divided
 into simple sub-areas, the finite elements.
 Due to their simple geometry, their physical behavior can be calculated
 well with known shape functions.
 This shape functions contain parameters that have a physical meaning at
 a certain point in component and time.
 The accuracy of the approximate solution can be improved by using more
 parameters, that means smaller elements or using approach functions of
 a higher grade.
 The physical behavior of the entire body is realized through the transition
 from one element to the next element.
 Since this method requires considerable computing power, the process thus
 benefits from the development of powerful computers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Discretion of the calculation domain: The first step is to divide a solution
 region into finite elements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Select interpolation functions (shape functions): The second step is to
 choose the interpolation function to interpolate the field variables over
 the elements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Define the element properties: Set the matrix equation for the finite elements,
 which relates the nodal values of the unknown function to other parameters.
 The most convenient method is the Galerkin method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Assemble the element equations: It should combine local equations for all
 elements which are used for discretization and the boundary conditions
 should also be considered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Solve the global equation system: It is a system of linear equations with
 a symmetric matrix.
 For the solution, direct or iterative methods can be used to find the unknown
 parameters.

Genetic Algorithms

\begin_layout Subsection
Historical Context and Basics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Genetic algorithms (GA) are machine learning models and optimization methods
 motivated by the evolutionary processes in nature and so the vocabulary
 was adopted from genetics.
 In this method, learning is understood as competition between evolved species
 in a population, and this makes the algorithms directed probability algorithms
 and thus much more efficient than random search algorithms.
 GAs were ﬁrst proposed by John Holland in the 1960s and further developed
 by his students and colleagues at the University of Michigan in the 1960s
 and 1970s 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Genetic algorithms are useful for many types of complex optimization tasks
 well suited:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
No fundamental limitations regarding the function to be optimized, such
 as continuity, derivability, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Particularly suitable for problems with a very large search space where
 an optimal search by listing all possible solutions is no longer possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The global extremum is sought and not just the nearest local extremum.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Genetic algorithms can be efficiently implemented on parallel computing
 structures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the weaknesses of the algorithm is that finding the optimal solution
 cannot be guaranteed.

The GA starts with a randomly generated population (a set of chromosomes)
 and the fitness is evaluated by the fitness function.
 Evolutionary it means that the fittest in the population survive and mathematic
ally the fitness function is the function that is trying to optimize the
 solution.
 While the termination condition is not achieved, the GA performs a fitness
 based selection, recombination and mutation process to create a succeeding
 population and subsequently the next generation.
 During recombination, parent chromosomes are selected and their genetic
 material is recombined to produce child chromosomes.
 These then advance into the next population.
 As this process is repeated, a sequence of successive generations develops
 and the average fitness of the chromosomes tends to increase until the
 termination criterion is reached.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The detailed structure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A GA consists of a number of different components.
 This is a special strength because it means that standard components can
 be reused in many different GAs with trivial customization, thus easing
 implementation

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Population
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to use a genetic algorithm, a solution space must first be specified.
 From the solution space an initial population is randomly generated which
 is a set of individuals or chromosomes.
 At this stage one can apply heuristics to give the algorithm a better starting
 position.
 A chromosome represents a point in the search space and consists of genes
 that represent the elements of a solution

Fitness and Objective Function
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fitness function of an individual 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(i_{k}\right)$
\end_inset

 in a population 
\begin_inset Formula $P=\left\{ i_{1},i_{2},...,i_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 gives the probability whether that individual can survive and thus pass
 on their genes.
 Since the fitness function is a positive real number, it is obtained by
 scaling from the objective function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(i)=scale(o(i))$
\end_inset

, which corresponds to the optimization goal of the optimization problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Selection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GA uses the selection to appoint individuals for reproduction as a new
 generation on the principle of biological evolution ''survival of the fittest''.
 Individuals with higher fitness have a greater chance of selection than
 those with lower fitness, thus creating selection pressure on the individuals
 in the direction of optimal solution.
 Choosing the right selection pressure is crucial, if the selection pressure
 is too high, the solution converges prematurely to the local optimum.
 However, if the selection pressure is too low, the optimal individuals
 are hardly favored.
 Therefore, the solution will either not converge or will only converge
 at a much slower rate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several selection methods and the choice is made according to
 the task.
 An example of such a method presented here is the selection scheme Stochastic
 Universal Sampling (SUS).
 In this process each Individual is assigned a segment on the roulette wheel.
 The size of the segment is proportional to fitness of the individual.
 The wheel is turned and then 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 pointers arranged evenly around the wheel choose 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 individuals for reproduction.
 A detailed description of the various selection schemes can be found in

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Crossover
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The crossover operator allows mixing of genetic material from selected initial
 chromosomes to create offspring chromosomes.
 After selecting two parent chromosomes for recombination, a random number
 is generated in the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,1]$
\end_inset

 with uniform probability and compared with a predetermined "crossover rate".
 If the random number is greater than the crossover rate, no crossover occurs
 and one or both parents will proceed unchanged to the next level or recombinati
on.
 If the crossover rate is greater than or equal to the random number, the
 crossover operator is applied Fig

The idea is not to get stuck in local minima but , through this method,
 to reach the global minima.The chosen values for the mutation probability
 pm are usually 0.01 or 0.001.

Termination
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the termination of GA there is a criterion needed.
 Therefore there are several possibilities like time constraints

 or the consideration of convergence.
 Another popular variant used for this implementation is a certain number
 of generations.

Shapiro-Wilk test
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Shapiro-Wilk test is a statistical significance test that tests the
 hypothesis that the underlying population of a sample is normally distributed.
 The test procedure was published in 1965 by American Samuel Shapiro and
 Canadian Martin Wilk 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "shapiro1965analysis"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The test can be used to test samples with 3 to 5000 observations and in
 addition to other well-known tests for normal distribution, such as such
 as the Kolmogorow-Smirnow test or the chi-square test, the Shapiro-Wilk
 test is characterized by its relatively large test performance, especially
 by smaller testing samples.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

In the implementation, the null hypothesis 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{0}$
\end_inset

 is first set up, which states that there is a normal distribution for a
 sample 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1},...,x_{n}$
\end_inset

 and a significance level is chosen, usually 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=5\%.$
\end_inset

 The critical test statistic 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

, which depends on sample size, is obtained from a given statistical table

\begin_inset Newline newline

For a given sample of size 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, the test statistic is calculated as follows
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
W= & \frac{\left(\overset{n}{\underset{i=1}{\sum}}a_{i}x^{\left(i\right)}\right)^{2}}{\overset{n}{\underset{i=1}{\sum}}\left(x_{i}-\bar{x}\right)^{2}}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

 is the Shapiro-Wilk constant given from the statistic table

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $x^{(i)}$
\end_inset

 is the ith smallest value of the number in the sample
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{x}$
\end_inset

 is the sample mean.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the value of the test statistic 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 is greater than the critical value 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $(W>W_{\alpha})$
\end_inset

 , so the null hypothesis is not rejected and a normal distribution is assumed.
 Otherwise, the null hypothesis must be abandoned and there is no normal
 distribution.
