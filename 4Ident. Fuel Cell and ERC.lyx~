Fuel cell technology use
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fuel cells belong to the group of galvanic elements, which, as electrochemical
 energy converters, can convert the chemical energy of a fuel into electrical
 energy.
 Since fuel cells can generate electricity directly from chemical energy,
 they are much more efficient than internal combustion engines

.
 The principle of the fuel cell was discovered in 1838 by Christian Friedrich
 Schönbein and soon after, Sir William Grove, along with Schönbein, recognized
 the reversal of electrolysis and power generation.
 With the invention of the electrical generator by Werner von Siemens, the
 invention known as the "gas battery" fell into oblivion.
 It wasn't until the 1950s that the idea was revived due to the need for
 compact and portable power sources in space travel and the military.
 Global warming and air pollution gave research into this technology decisive
 impetus that continues to this day.

 or nickel and a membrane Fig

\begin_layout Standard
The anode is supplied with hydrogen 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\textrm{\mathsf{\textrm{H}}}_{2}\right]$
\end_inset

, which oxidizes to protons 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[2\mathsf{\textrm{H}}^{+}\right]$
\end_inset

 on the catalyst layer, giving off electrons 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[2\textrm{e}^{-}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 The proton exchange membran (PEM) is only permeable for ions, so only the
 ions flow to the cathode via PEM.
 The electrons flow from the anode to the cathode via an external circuit
 and form the electric current.
 Both hydrogen protons and electrons migrate to the cathode, where they
 react with the supplied oxygen 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\textrm{O}_{2}\right]$
\end_inset

 to form water 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\textrm{H}_{2}\textrm{O}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 Depending on the operating point, a single cell delivers a certain voltage
 between 0.5 and 1.0 volts.
 For higher voltages, individual cells are connected in series and a so-called
 stack is obtained as the core element of the fuel cell.

\begin_layout Subsection
Types of fuel cells
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are different types of fuel cells, which differ in the electrolyte
 used, in the operating temperature, in the fuels that can be used and in
 the power range and thus the areas of application Fig

AFC are among the earliest researched fuel cell types and were mainly used
 in space travel deployed.
 Operating efficiency: about 60% to 70%.
 Proton Exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) use membrane foil called Nafion
 and Electrodes with platinum layers as catalysts.
 They are powered by hydrogen or finely purified reformate from simple hydrocarb
ons such as natural gas, LPG or alcohols.
 These cells are used in home power supplies, power plants, submarines and
 space travel and have an efficiency of 40-60%.
 Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC) are operated with liquid methanol and
 a membrane foil is used as the electrolyte.
 Due to the low power density, these cells are mainly used as battery chargers.
 Molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFC) have a molten carbonate electrolyte.
 Because of the operating temperature of approx.
 650°C and the resulting high reaction speeds, therefore no expensive noble
 metal catalysts are required.
 They are operated with desulfurized natural and coal gas or suitably cleaned
 biogas.
 MCFC systems are developed for the power plant range from 200 kW to several
 MW and have an efficiency of 50% to 65%.
 Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) are operated with a solid ceramic metal oxide
 as the electrolyte.
 The operating temperature of 800°C enable that no expensive noble metal
 catalysts are required.
 These cells can be operated with fossil gases or biogas.
 SOFC systems are developed in the power range from 1 kW to 200 kW and have
 an efficiency of 60-65%

\begin_layout Subsection
Challenges and solution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fuel technology is mature in many areas and in regular operation.
 In particular, passenger cars, forklifts and micro combined heat and power
 plants (CHP) for residential buildings are among the mature applications
 and are already commercially available, followed by buses, emergency generators
, industrial CHP plants and various network services.
 However, there are many possible ones Hydrogen and fuel applications Cells
 where no comparable experiences have been made so far and which are still
 in the research and development phase.
 These include, for example Trains, waste disposal vehicles and delivery
 vehicles, but also heavy duty trucks as well airplanes and ships.
 The challenge for the use of the technology also remains in terms of infrastruc
ture as well as expanding the filling stations for hydrogen.
 In addition to the infrastructure The further development of the production
 facilities is a challenge, especially in the transition to serial production.
 For this reason Know-how transfer is essential for the market ramp-up,
 to reduce existing reservations and gaps in knowledge
