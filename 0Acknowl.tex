\section{Acknowledgement}

First and foremost, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to
my supervisor, Professor Marcus Stiemer, for his tireless support
in this work and research. I am especially grateful for the many intensive
discussions that have enabled me to grow into a better scientist.\\
\\
I would like to thank Professor .... very warmly for taking over the
co-referee, his interest in the topic and the friendly interaction
within the PhD procedure.\\
\\
I would also like to thank Dr. Lars Ole Fichte, M.Sc. Ilda Cahani
and Dr. Marita Wendt for patiently reviewing the Dissertation and
the moral and professional support. My special thanks go to our technician
Andreas Priesmeyer for his support in the area of hardware and software,
without which the project would not have been possible.\\
\\
I would also like to thank all current and former employees of the
chair for the pleasant working atmosphere.\\
\\
Finally, I would like to thank my family for their moral support during
my studies, because without them I would not have been able to complete
this dissertation.\\
\\
\\
This work is dedicated to my father who passed away from COVID-19
(coronavirus disease 2019). May his soul rest in peace.
