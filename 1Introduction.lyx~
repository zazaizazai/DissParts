Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Global warming and air pollution is one of the main problems facing mankind.
 The main reason for this is the dependence on fossil energy, which is neither
 sustainable nor environmentally friendly.
 Fuel cell technologies represent one of the most promising technological
 advances to contain the situation.
 In addition to producing clean energy, fuel cells have the advantage of
 being transportable.
 Meanwhile, fuel cells are used in many applications, for example in supporting
 facilities, vehicles and electronic systems.
 In order to improve cell operational performance, the analysis of operational
 parameters is required and these parameters are also of central importance
 in the dimensions of the cell.
 A three-dimensional High temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells
 (HT-PEMFC) with with polybenzimidazole (PBI) membrane model developed in
 Comsol Multiphysics by the group Ubong et al.

Next, this thesis deals with an electromagnetic reverberation chamber (ERC).
 An electromagnetic reverberation chamber serves as an ideally isolated
 environment where device under test (DUT) are subjected to electromagnetic
 waves in order to closely observe the effects.
 The field for the chamber is generated by a Vivaldi antenna, which in turn
 stimulates so-called modes by multiple reflections of electrical waves
 on metal walls.
 The transmit antenna also irradiates a rotatable metal reflector structure
 (Stirrer) in the chamber, which swirls the modes and creates a spatially
 limited, homogeneous electric field in the chamber.
 The geometry of the stirrer and their quantity is decisive for how well
 the field is distributed homogeneously.
 Another way to influence the field distribution is to attach geometric
 objects to the chamber wall, which has been done to a limited extent by
 the group Selemani et al.

.
 Cases such as the stirrer geometry, the number of stirrers in the chamber
 and the attachment of geometric objects to the chamber walls are examined
 in order to obtain the best possible solution.
 When selecting the antenna frequency, the formula from Hans Georg Krauth√§user's
 habilitation thesis is taken into account.
 To be on the safe side when choosing the frequency, three times this limit
 frequency is used

Whether finding the operating parameters for the fuel cell for a given performan
ce or choosing the right geometry for a better field distribution in the
 chamber, these are all optimization problems from a mathematical point
 of view.
 One can select these desired boundary condition as a prompt and solve it
 numerically with an algorithm.
 The genetic algorithms in Matlab, which is connected to Comsol Multiphysics
 via an interface, is used for the optimization.
