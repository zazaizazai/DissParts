Conclusion and Outlook
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Starting with the optimization of the fuel cell, it is evident that a desired
 power density curve can be approximated very well by adjusting the parameters
 through the optimization.
 Interestingly, different parameter settings also lead to the same power-density
 graph.
 This means that the solution is not clear here, which in turn could be
 used for a specific desired parameter setting.
 For further investigations it would be important to include the temperature
 generated by the operation in the simulations, which was choosen as constant
 for this work.
 The effect of this temperature on performance is desirable.

\begin_layout Standard
Next was the achievement of a Statistically uniform and isotropic field
 studied in an electromagnetic reverbration cuboid chamber, with a Vivaldi
 antenna as source.
 The field turbulence was provided by a stirrer whose geometry plays a crucial
 role in field distribution.
 In this work, the shape of the stirrer wings were optimized to achieve
 the best possible field distribution.
 This enabled the desired values to be achieved except for the real part
 of the field in the y-direction.
 In order to further improve the field distribution values, the number of
 stirrers was increased to three pieces.
 The wing shapes have also been optimized here.
 The field in the y-direction could be improved, but the field values in
 the other spatial directions deteriorated.
 Despite this fact, in all spatial directions, the desired acceptance limits
 for the field distribution was observed.
 Next, a certain number of two different geometric objects (cone and sphere)
 were attached to the wall chamber and their influence on the field distribution
 was examined.
 Here the hemispheres provided a better field distribution than cones.
 Here the hemispheres provided a better field distribution than cones, so
 this would be a better choice for further investigation.
 For further investigations it would also be interesting to optimize the
 topology of the stirrer.
 To do this, one does not assume a rectangular sheet metal as the basic
 shape of a stirrer, but calculates the optimal shape completely mathematically.
